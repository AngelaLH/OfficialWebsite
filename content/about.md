### Why this blog?

---

We are overloaded with information about every topic. How do we separate the evidence based experts from those relying on personal experience and anecdotes? In this blog, I will be collating the most reliable resources on self-improvement topics to save you from hours of searching. 

As we all prefer various mediums, I include podcasts, videos, apps, workbooks, articles and books. 

I enjoy collating resources for some reason, so I hope my joy can save you time.
