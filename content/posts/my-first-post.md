# What have I actually used?

---

I read various books that included a chapter on habits. Every habit forming advice I have found useful is in Atomic Habits and more. His writing is clear, concise, evidence based and includes gripping stories that make his lessons stick. Habit forming advice I implement includes:

### What works for me

- Tracking - I check off my habits in notion at the end of the day
- Implementation Intentions/TAPs (popular in the rationalist community) - When I go to the kitchen and feel like getting a snack, I get a glass of water.
- Keystone Habits/Habit pairing - I use pomodoro in the morning and do important habits in the 5 minute breaks.
- Identity formation - I started going to the gym to match my identity of a disciplined person
- Systems  - Systems inspired me to join toastmasters and do a speech every month to improve my public speaking in a systematized way.
- Design your environment for your habits (Make it easy) - My desk has my supplements near by, and by moisturizer is right next to my draws when I get changed. My room used to be a mess all the time, until I got easy to open draws with cubbies for easy access to make getting clothes systematized.

### What didn't work for me

- I used Habitica with my friends to increase accountability for a few months and it was amazing for my productivity. However, I got discouraged when the competition got too fierce, so there has to be some balance there.
- I tried another accountability group, but messaging the group was not a bad enough consequence. Nir Eyal in Indistractable recommends making the consequence of not doing the habit unbearable i.e. having to burn $100 every time he doesn't go to the gym. This is likely why habitica worked for me better than a low consequence accountability group.
